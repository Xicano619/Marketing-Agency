This project came about for the purpose of refactoring the code (website) to make accessible. The following list will show the refactoring that was worked on:
-Semantics (Html & CSS)
-Commenting 
-Reworked CSS to make more efficient
-Included 'ALT' attributes
-Assure that Img., and links worked
-Webpage to meet accessibility standards

My motivation in taking this project was to sharpen my skills in refactoring and brush up on the accessibility standards.
